  abstract={One-time login process in conventional authentication systems does not guarantee that the identified user is the actual user throughout the session. However, it is necessary to re-verify the user identity periodically throughout a login session, which is lacking in existing one-time login systems.However, existing methods for Continuous Authentication are either not reliable or not usable. In thispaper, we introduce Wearable-Assisted Continuous Authentication (WACA), which relies on the sensor-based keystroke dynamics and the authentication data is acquired through the built-in sensors of a wearable (e.g., smartwatch) while the useris typing. The acquired data is periodically and transparently compared with the registered profile of the initially logged-in user withone-way classifiers. We implemented theWACA framework and evaluated its performance extensively on real devices with real users. The empirical evaluation of WACA revealsthat WACA is feasible and its error rate is as low as 1% with 30 seconds of processing time and 2 â€“ 3% for 20 seconds. The computational overhead is minimal. Furthermore, WACA is capable of identifying insider threats with very high accuracy (99.2%) and also robust against powerful adversaries such as imitation and statistical attackers. We believe that this work has practical and far-reaching implications for the future of the usable authentication field.},
