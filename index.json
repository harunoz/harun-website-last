As in any software, uncovering vulnerabilities on Android devices and applying timely patches are both critical. Android Open Source Project (AOSP) has initiated efforts to improve the traceability of security updates through Security Patch Levels (SPLs) assigned to devices. While this initiative provided better traceability for the vulnerabilities, it has not entirely resolved the issues related to the timeliness and availability of security updates for end users. Recent studies on Android security updates have focused on the issue of delay during the security update roll-out, largely attributing this to factors related to fragmentation. However, these studies fail to capture the entire Android ecosystem as they primarily examine flagship devices or do not paint a comprehensive picture of the Android devices’ lifecycle due to the datasets spanning over a short timeframe. To address this gap in the literature, we utilize a device-centric approach to analyze the security update behavior of Android devices. Our approach aims to understand the security update distribution behavior of OEMs (e.g., Samsung) by using a representative set of devices from each OEM and characterize the complete lifecycle of an average Android device. We obtained 367K official security update records from public sources, spanning from 2014 to 2023. Our dataset contains 599 unique devices from four major OEMs that are used in 97 countries and are associated with 109 carriers. We identify significant differences in the roll-out of security updates across different OEMs, device models/types, and geographical regions across the world. Our findings show that the reasons for the delay in the roll-out of security updates are not limited to fragmentation but also involve OEM-specific factors. Our analysis also uncovers certain key issues regarding the security update distribution that can be readily addressed as well as exemplary practices that can be immediately adopted by OEMs in practice.","tags":[],"title":"50 Shades of Support: A Device-Centric Analysis of Android Security Updates","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Our paper, titled \u0026#34;50 Shades of Support: A Device-Centric Analysis of Android Security Updates\u0026#34; has been accepted for publication at NDSS 2024.\n","date":1693872000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693872000,"objectID":"c13506ce15838757060d6b06dc61733b","permalink":"https://abbasacar.github.io/news/ndss-2024/","publishdate":"2023-09-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/ndss-2024/","section":"news","summary":"Our paper, titled \"50 Shades of Support: A Device-Centric Analysis of Android Security Updates\" has been accepted for publication at [NDSS 2024](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2024/).","tags":[],"title":"","type":"news"},{"authors":["Harun Oz","Ahmet Aris","Abbas Acar","Guliz Seray Tuncay","Leonardo Babun","Selcuk Uluagac"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1690848000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690848000,"objectID":"9f946ec81923f6e4908e588beff6f91a","permalink":"https://abbasacar.github.io/publication/rob/","publishdate":"2023-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rob/","section":"publication","summary":"File System Access (FSA) API enables web applications to interact with files on the users’ local devices. Even though it can be used to develop rich web applications, it greatly extends the attack surface, which can be abused by adversaries to cause significant harm. In this paper, for the first time in the literature, we extensively study this new attack vector that can be used to develop a powerful new ransomware strain over a browser. Using the FSA API and WebAssembly technology, we demonstrate this novel browser-based ransomware called RØB as a malicious web application that encrypts the user’s files from the browser. We use RØB to perform impact analysis with different OSs, local directories, and antivirus solutions as well as to develop mitigation techniques against it. Our evaluations show that RØB can encrypt the victim’s local files including cloud-integrated directories, external storage devices, and network-shared folders regardless of the access limitations imposed by the API. Moreover, we evaluate and show how the existing defense solutions fall short against RØB in terms of their feasibility. We propose three potential defense solutions to mitigate this new attack vector. These solutions operate at different levels (i.e., browser-level, filesystem-level, and user-level) and are orthogonal to each other. Our work strives to raise awareness of the dangers of RØBlike browser-based ransomware strains and shows that the emerging API documentation (i.e., the popular FSA) can be equivocal in terms of reflecting the extent of the threat.","tags":[],"title":"RøB: Ransomware over Modern Web Browsers","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Our paper, titled \u0026#34;RøB: Ransomware over Modern Web Browsers\u0026#34; has been accepted for publication at USENIX Security 2023.\n","date":1685577600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685577600,"objectID":"1f7a926cfee64960fe66679d9e431e9c","permalink":"https://abbasacar.github.io/news/usenix-2023/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/usenix-2023/","section":"news","summary":"Our paper, titled \"RøB: Ransomware over Modern Web Browsers\" has been accepted for publication at [USENIX Security 2023](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/technical-sessions).","tags":[],"title":"","type":"news"},{"authors":["Nazli Tekin","Abbas Acar","Ahmet Aris","Selcuk Uluagac","Vehbi Cagri Gungor"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"b9404a14718ec3f6043793b1cd2eaef0","permalink":"https://abbasacar.github.io/publication/elsevier-iot-tekin/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/elsevier-iot-tekin/","section":"publication","summary":"Recently, Smart Home Systems (SHSs) have gained enormous popularity with the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. Besides offering many tangible benefits, SHSs are vulnerable to attacks that lead to security and privacy concerns for SHS users. Machine learning (ML)-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are proposed to address such concerns. Conventionally, ML models are trained and tested on computationally powerful platforms such as cloud services. Nevertheless, the data shared with the cloud is vulnerable to privacy attacks and causes latency, which decreases the performance of real-time applications like intrusion detection systems. Therefore, on-device ML models, in which the user data is kept locally, have emerged as promising solutions to ensure the security and privacy of the data for real-time applications. However, performing ML tasks requires high energy consumption. To the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted to analyze the energy consumption of ML-based IDS. Therefore, in this paper, we perform a comparative analysis of on-device ML algorithms in terms of energy consumption for IoT intrusion detection applications. For a thorough analysis, we study the training and inference phases separately. For training, we compare the cloud computing-based ML, edge computing-based ML, and IoT device-based ML approaches. For the inference, we evaluate the TinyML approach to run the ML algorithms on tiny IoT devices such as Micro Controller Units (MCUs). Comparative performance evaluations show that deploying the Decision Tree (DT) algorithm on-device gives better results in terms of training time, inference time, and power consumption.","tags":null,"title":"Energy consumption of on-device machine learning models for IoT intrusion detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Javier Franco","Abbas Acar","Ahmet Aris","Selcuk Uluagac"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"66e2086ad9af88c80b643fe16b969a84","permalink":"https://abbasacar.github.io/publication/docker-cryptojacking/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/docker-cryptojacking/","section":"publication","summary":"Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have transformed financial transactions and created opportunities to profit from generating new coins through cryptomining.

Within the numerous uses of Wasm, not all of them are benign. With the rise of Wasm-based cryptojacking malware, analyzing Wasm applications has been a hot topic in the literature, resulting in numerous Wasm-based cryptojacking detection systems. Many of these methods rely on static analysis, which traditionally can be circumvented through obfuscation. However, the feasibility of the obfuscation techniques for Wasm programs has never been investigated thoroughly. In this paper, we address this gap and perform the first look at code obfuscation for Wasm. We apply numerous obfuscation techniques to Wasm programs, and test their effectiveness in producing a fully obfuscated Wasm program. Particularly, we obfuscate both benign Wasm-based web applications and cryptojacking malware instances and feed them into a state-of-the-art Wasm cryptojacking detector to see if current Wasm analysis methods can be subverted with obfuscation.

Prior works studied the cryptojacking detection systems focusing on both in-browser and host-based cryptojacking malware. However, none of these earlier works investigated different attack configurations and network settings in this context. For example, an attacker with an aggressive profit strategy may increase computational resources to the maximum utilization to benefit more in a short time, while a stealthy attacker may want to stay undetected longer time on the victim’s device. The accuracy of the detection mechanism may differ for an aggressive and stealthy attacker. Not only profit strategies, but also the cryptojacking malware type, the victim’s device as well as various network settings where the network is fully or partially compromised may play a key role in the performance evaluation of the detection mechanisms. In addition, smart home networks with multiple IoT devices are easily exploited by the attackers, and they are equipped to mine cryptocurrency on behalf of the attacker. However, no prior works investigated the impact of cryptojacking malware on IoT devices and compromised smart home networks. In this paper, we first propose an accurate and efficient IoT cryptojacking detection mechanism based on network traffic features, which can detect both in-browser and host-based cryptojacking. Then, we focus on the cryptojacking implementation problem on new device categories (eg, IoT) and designed several novel experiment scenarios to assess our detection mechanism to cover the current attack surface of the attackers. Particularly, we tested our mechanism in various attack configurations and network settings. For this, we used a dataset of network traces consisting of 6.4 M network packets and showed that our detection algorithm can obtain accuracy as high as 99% with only one-hour of training data.

To fill this gap, in this paper, we introduce VERITAS, a novel and practical digital forensic capability for the smart environment. VERITAS has two main components, Collector and Analyzer. The Collector implements mechanisms to automatically collect forensically-relevant data from the smart environment. Then, in the event of a forensic investigation, the Analyzer uses a First Order Markov Chain model to extract valuable and usable forensic information from the collected data. VERITAS then uses the forensic information to infer activities and behaviors from users, devices, and apps that violate the security policies defined for the environment. We implemented and tested VERITAS in a realistic smart office environment with 22 smart devices and sensors that generated 84209 forensically-valuable incidents. The evaluation shows that VERITAS achieves over 95% of accuracy in inferring different anomalous activities and forensic behaviors within the smart environment. Finally, VERITAS is extremely lightweight, yielding no overhead on the devices and minimal overhead in the backend resources (ie, the cloud servers).","tags":[],"title":"The truth shall set thee free: Enabling practical forensic capabilities in smart environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Two papers, \u0026#34;A Lightweight IoT Cryptojacking Detection Mechanism in Heterogeneous Smart Home Networks\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;The Truth Shall Set Thee Free: Enabling Practical Forensic Capabilities in Smart Environments\u0026#34; have been accepted for publication at NDSS 2022.\n","date":1638662400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638662400,"objectID":"112a184f1f55866af8600e809375ee98","permalink":"https://abbasacar.github.io/news/ndss-2022/","publishdate":"2021-12-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/ndss-2022/","section":"news","summary":"Two papers, \"A Lightweight IoT Cryptojacking Detection Mechanism in Heterogeneous Smart Home Networks\" and \"The Truth Shall Set Thee Free: Enabling Practical Forensic Capabilities in Smart Environments\" have been accepted for publication at [NDSS 2022](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2022/accepted-papers/).","tags":[],"title":"","type":"news"},{"authors":["Abbas Acar","Shoukat Ali","Koray Karabina","Cengiz Kaygusuz","Hidayet Aksu","Kemal Akkaya","Selcuk Uluagac"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"d23d94cec35c53fd10864cd61c0eed29","permalink":"https://abbasacar.github.io/publication/paca-tops/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/paca-tops/","section":"publication","summary":"As many vulnerabilities of one-time authentication systems have already been uncovered, there is a growing need and trend to adopt continuous authentication systems. Biometrics provides an excellent means for periodic verification of the authenticated users without breaking the continuity of a session. Nevertheless, as attacks to computing systems increase, biometric systems demand more user information in their operations, yielding privacy issues for users in biometric-based continuous authentication systems. However, the current state-of-the-art privacy technologies are not viable or costly for the continuous authentication systems, which require periodic real-time verification. In this article, we introduce a novel, lightweight, privacy-aware, and secure continuous authentication protocol called PACA. PACA is initiated through a password-based key exchange (PAKE) mechanism, and it continuously authenticates users based on their biometrics in a privacy-aware manner. Then, we design an actual continuous user authentication system under the proposed protocol. In this concrete system, we utilize a privacy-aware template matching technique and a wearable-assisted keystroke dynamics-based continuous authentication method. This provides privacy guarantees without relying on any trusted third party while allowing the comparison of noisy user inputs (due to biometric data) and yielding an efficient and lightweight protocol. Finally, we implement our system on an Apple smartwatch and perform experiments with real user data to evaluate the accuracy and resource consumption of our concrete system.","tags":[],"title":"A Lightweight Privacy-Aware Continuous Authentication Protocol-PACA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ege Tekiner","Abbas Acar","Selcuk Uluagac","Engin Kirda","Ali Aydin Selcuk"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"437b3792f46abc8463763d288b2d762a","permalink":"https://abbasacar.github.io/publication/permissioned/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/permissioned/","section":"publication","summary":"In-browser cryptomining uses the computational power of a website's visitors to mine cryptocurrency, i.e., to create new coins. With the rise of ready-to-use mining scripts distributed by service providers (e.g., Coinhive), it has become trivial to turn a website into a cryptominer by copying and pasting the mining script. Both legitimate webpage owners who want to raise an extra revenue under users' explicit consent and malicious actors who wish to exploit the computational power of the users' computers without their consent have started to utilize this emerging paradigm of cryptocurrency operations. In-browser cryptomining, though mostly abused by malicious actors in practice, is indeed a promising funding model that can be utilized by website owners, publishers, or non-profit organizations for legitimate business purposes, such as to collect revenue or donations for humanitarian projects, inter alia. However, our analysis in this paper shows that in practice, regardless of their being legitimate or not, all in-browser mining scripts are treated the same as malicious cryptomining samples (aka cryptojacking) and blacklisted by browser extensions or antivirus programs. Indeed, there is a need for a better understanding of the in-browser cryptomining ecosystem. Hence, in this paper, we present an in-depth empirical analysis of in-browser cryptomining processes, focusing on the samples explicitly asking for user consent, which we call permissioned cryptomining. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study focusing on the permissioned cryptomining samples. For this, we created a dataset of 6269 unique web sites containing cryptomining scripts in their source codes to characterize the in-browser cryptomining ecosystem by differentiating permissioned and permissionless cryptomining samples. We believe that (1) this paper is the first attempt showing that permissioned in-browser cryptomining could be a legitimate and viable monetization tool if implemented responsibly and without interrupting the user, and (2) this paper will catalyze the widespread adoption of legitimate crvptominina with user consent and awareness.","tags":[],"title":"In-Browser Cryptomining for Good: An Untold Story","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ege Tekiner","Abbas Acar","Selcuk Uluagac","Engin Kirda","Ali Aydin Selcuk"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"f84c83ae94d624d7e8abf6bbba390664","permalink":"https://abbasacar.github.io/publication/cryptojacking-sok/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cryptojacking-sok/","section":"publication","summary":"Emerging blockchain and cryptocurrency-based technologies are redefining the way we conduct business in cyberspace. Today, a myriad of blockchain and cryp-tocurrency systems, applications, and technologies are widely available to companies, end-users, and even malicious actors who want to exploit the computational resources of regular users through cryptojacking malware. Especially with ready-to-use mining scripts easily provided by service providers (e.g., Coinhive) and untraceable cryptocurrencies (e.g., Monero), cryptojacking malware has become an indispensable tool for attackers. Indeed, the banking industry, major commercial websites, government and military servers (e.g., US Dept. of Defense), online video sharing platforms (e.g., Youtube), gaming platforms (e.g., Nintendo), critical infrastructure resources (e.g., routers), and even recently widely popular remote video conferencing/meeting programs (e.g., Zoom during the Covid-19 pandemic) have all been the victims of powerful cryptojacking malware campaigns. Nonetheless, existing detection methods such as browser extensions that protect users with blacklist methods or antivirus programs with different analysis methods can only provide a partial panacea to this emerging crypto-jacking issue as the attackers can easily bypass them by using obfuscation techniques or changing their domains or scripts frequently. Therefore, many studies in the literature proposed cryptojacking malware detection methods using various dynamic/behavioral features. However, the literature lacks a systemic study with a deep understanding of the emerging cryptojacking malware and a comprehensive review of studies in the literature. To fill this gap in the literature, in this SoK paper, we present a systematic overview of cryptojacking malware based on the information obtained from the combination of academic research papers, two large cryptojacking datasets of samples, and 45 major attack instances.

However, it is necessary to re-verify the user identity periodically throughout a login session, which is lacking in existing one-time login systems. Continuous authentication, which re-verifies the user identity without breaking the continuity of the session, can address this issue. However, existing methods for Continuous Authentication are either not reliable or not usable. In this paper, we introduce a usable and reliable Wearable-Assisted Continuous Authentication (WACA), which relies on the sensor-based keystroke dynamics and the authentication data is acquired through the built-in sensors of a wearable (e.g., smartwatch) while the user is typing. The acquired data is periodically and transparently compared with the registered profile of the initially logged-in user with one-way classifiers. With this, WACA continuously ensures that the current user is the user who logged-in initially. We implemented the WACA framework and evaluated its performance extensively on real devices with real users. The empirical evaluation of WACA reveals that WACA is feasible, and its error rate is as low as 1 percent with 30 seconds of processing time and 2-3 percent for 20 seconds. The computational overhead is minimal. Furthermore, WACA is capable of identifying insider threats with very high accuracy (99.2 percent) and also robust against powerful adversaries such as imitation and statistical attackers.

Traditional access control mechanisms consider one unique trusted user that controls the access to the devices. However, multi-user multi-device smart home settings pose fundamentally different challenges to traditional single-user systems. For instance, in a multi-user environment, users have conflicting, complex, and dynamically changing demands on multiple devices, which cannot be handled by traditional access control techniques. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce Kratos, a novel multi-user and multi-device-aware access control mechanism that allows smart home users to flexibly specify their access control demands. Kratos has three main components, user interaction module, back-end server, and policy manager. Users can specify their desired access control settings using the interaction module which are translated into access control policies in the backend server. The policy manager analyzes these policies and initiates negotiation between users to resolve conflicting demands and generates final policies. We implemented Kratos and evaluated its performance on real smart home deployments featuring multi-user scenarios with a rich set of configurations (309 different policies including 213 demand conflicts and 24 restriction policies). These configurations included five different threats associated with access control mechanisms. Our extensive evaluations show that Kratos is very effective in resolving conflicting access control demands with minimal overhead, and robust against different attacks.","tags":[],"title":"Kratos: Multi-user multi-device-aware access control system for the smart home","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abbas Acar","Hossein Fereidooni","Tigist Abera","Amit Kumar Sikder","Markus Miettinen","Hidayet Aksu","Mauro Conti","Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi","Selcuk Uluagac"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"4acb11b8825a308ca0b1f17971a9c431","permalink":"https://abbasacar.github.io/publication/peek-a-boo/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/peek-a-boo/","section":"publication","summary":"A myriad of IoT devices such as bulbs, switches, speakers in a smart home environment allow users to easily control the physical world around them and facilitate their living styles through the sensors already embedded in these devices. Sensor data contains a lot of sensitive information about the user and devices. However, an attacker inside or near a smart home environment can potentially exploit the innate wireless medium used by these devices to exfiltrate sensitive information from the encrypted payload (i.e., sensor data) about the users and their activities, invading user privacy. With this in mind, in this work, we introduce a novel multi-stage privacy attack against user privacy in a smart environment. It is realized utilizing state-of-the-art machine-learning approaches for detecting and identifying the types of IoT devices, their states, and ongoing user activities in a cascading style by only passively sniffing the network traffic from smart home devices and sensors. The attack effectively works on both encrypted and unencrypted communications. We evaluate the efficiency of the attack with real measurements from an extensive set of popular off-the-shelf smart home IoT devices utilizing a set of diverse network protocols like WiFi, ZigBee, and BLE. Our results show that an adversary passively sniffing the traffic can achieve very high accuracy (above 90%) in identifying the state and actions of targeted smart home devices and their users. To protect against this privacy leakage, we also propose a countermeasure based on generating spoofed traffic to hide the device states and demonstrate that it provides better protection than existing solutions.","tags":[],"title":"Peek-a-boo: I see your smart home activities, even encrypted!","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?

Traditionally, behavioral biometrics (eg, keystroke dynamics) have been known to have the best usability because they do not require one to know or possess anything—they simply communicate “how you type” to an authenticator. However, though highly usable, MFA approaches that are based on biometrics are highly intrusive, and users' sensitive information is exposed to untrusted servers. To address this privacy concern, in this paper, we present a privacy-preserving MFA system for computer users, called PINTA. In PINTA, the second factor is a hybrid behavioral profile user, while the first authentication factor is a password. The hybrid profile of the user includes host-based and network flow-based features. Since the features include users' sensitive information, it needs to be protected from untrusted parties. To protect users' sensitive profiles and to handle the varying nature of the user profiles, we adopt two cryptographic methods, Fuzzy hashing and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Our results show that PINTA can successfully validate legitimate users and detect impostors. Although the results are promising, the trade-off for privacy preservation is a slight reduction in performance compared with traditional identity-based MFA techniques.","tags":[],"title":"A privacy-preserving multifactor authentication system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abbas Acar","Long Lu","Selcuk Uluagac","Engin Kirda"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"a3ea11c9db1122ff4515d43100d42bde","permalink":"https://abbasacar.github.io/publication/malware-trends/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/malware-trends/","section":"publication","summary":"We present an empirical and large-scale analysis of malware samples captured from two different enterprises from 2017 to early 2018. Particularly, we perform threat vector, social-engineering, vulnerability and time-series analysis on our dataset. Unlike existing malware studies, our analysis is specifically focused on the recent enterprise malware samples. First of all, based on our analysis on the combined datasets of two enterprises, our results confirm the general consensus that AV-only solutions are not enough for real-time defenses in enterprise settings because on average 40% of the malware samples, when first appeared, are not detected by most AVs on VirusTotal or not uploaded to VT at all (i.e., never seen in the wild yet). Moreover, our analysis also shows that enterprise users transfer documents more than executables and other types of files. Therefore, attackers embed malicious codes into documents to download and install the actual malicious payload instead of sending malicious payload directly or using vulnerability exploits. Moreover, we also found that financial matters (e.g., purchase orders and invoices) are still the most common subject seen in Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams that aim to trick employees. Finally, based on our analysis on the timestamps of captured malware samples, we found that 93% of the malware samples were delivered on weekdays. Our further analysis also showed that while the malware samples that require user interaction such as macro-based malware samples have been captured during the working hours of the employees, the massive malware attacks are triggered during the off-times of the employees to be able to silently spread over the networks.","tags":[],"title":"An Analysis of Malware Trends in Enterprise Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Z.

Sharing through secure computation and other means allow these partners to perform privacy-preserving computations on their private data in controlled ways. However, in reality, there exist complex relationships among members (partners). Politics, regulations, interest, trust, data demands and needs prevent members from sharing their complete data. Thus, there is a need for a mechanism to meet these conflicting relationships on data sharing. This paper presents, an approach to exchange data among members who have complex relationships. A novel policy language, CPL, that allows members to define the specifications of data exchange requirements is introduced. With CPL, members can easily assert who and what to exchange through their local policies and negotiate a global sharing agreement. The agreement is implemented in a distributed privacy-preserving model that guarantees sharing among members will comply with the policy as negotiated. The use of Curie is validated through an example healthcare application built on recently introduced secure multi-party computation and differential privacy frameworks, and policy and performance trade-offs are explored.","tags":[],"title":"Curie: Policy-based Secure Data Exchange","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abbas Acar","Hidayet Aksu","Selcuk Uluagac","Mauro Conti"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"c221a5fa76438e4052930db308a93ab3","permalink":"https://abbasacar.github.io/publication/fhe-survey-csur/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fhe-survey-csur/","section":"publication","summary":"Legacy encryption systems depend on sharing a key (public or private) among the peers involved in exchanging an encrypted message. However, this approach poses privacy concerns. The users or service providers with the key have exclusive rights on the data. Especially with popular cloud services, control over the privacy of the sensitive data is lost. Even when the keys are not shared, the encrypted material is shared with a third party that does not necessarily need to access the content. Moreover, untrusted servers, providers, and cloud operators can keep identifying elements of users long after users end the relationship with the services. Indeed, Homomorphic Encryption (HE), a special kind of encryption scheme, can address these concerns as it allows any third party to operate on the encrypted data without decrypting it in advance. Although this extremely useful feature of the HE scheme has been known for over 30 years, the first plausible and achievable Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) scheme, which allows any computable function to perform on the encrypted data, was introduced by Craig Gentry in 2009. Even though this was a major achievement, different implementations so far demonstrated that FHE still needs to be improved significantly to be practical on every platform. Therefore, this survey focuses on HE and FHE schemes. First, we present the basics of HE and the details of the well-known Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE) and Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SWHE), which are important pillars for achieving FHE. Then, the main FHE families, which have become the base for the other follow-up FHE schemes, are presented. Furthermore, the implementations and recent improvements in Gentry-type FHE schemes are also surveyed. Finally, further research directions are discussed. This survey is intended to give a clear knowledge and foundation to researchers and practitioners interested in knowing, applying, and extending the state-of-the-art HE, PHE, SWHE, and FHE systems.","tags":null,"title":"A survey on homomorphic encryption schemes: Theory and implementation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amit Kumar Sikder","Abbas Acar","Hidayet Aksu","Selcuk Uluagac","Kemal Akkaya","Mauro Conti"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"8ed16adf0c6a06c2cc7e8c830d4c1c30","permalink":"https://abbasacar.github.io/publication/smart-lighting/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/smart-lighting/","section":"publication","summary":"Over the past few decades, the rate of urbanization has increased enormously. More enhanced services and applications are needed in urban areas to provide a better lifestyle. Smart city, which is a concept of interconnecting modern digital technologies in the context of a city, is a potential solution to enhance the quality and performance of urban services. With the introduction of Internet-of-Things (IoT) in the smart city, new opportunities have emerged to develop new services and integrate different application domains with each other using Information and Communication Technologies. However, to ensure seamless services in an IoT-enabled smart city environment, all the applications have to be maintained with limited energy resources. One of the core sectors that can be improved significantly by implementing IoT is the lighting system of a city since it consumes more energy than other parts of a city. In a smart city, the lighting system is integrated with advanced sensors and communication channels to obtain a Smart Lighting System (SLS). The goal of an SLS is to obtain an autonomous and more efficient lighting management system. In this paper, we provide an overview of the SLS and review different IoT-enabled communication protocols, which can be used to realize the SLS in the context of a smart city. Moreover, we analyzed different usage scenarios for IoT-enabled indoor and outdoor SLS and provide an analysis of the power consumption. Our results reveal that IoT-enabled smart lighting systems can reduce power consumption up to 33.33% in both indoor and outdoor settings. Finally, we discussed the future research directions in SLS in the smart city.","tags":[],"title":"IoT-enabled smart lighting systems for smart cities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abbas Acar","Hidayet Aksu","Kemal Akkaya","Selcuk Uluagac"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"bc2d29c64f6fdff47179323b3f414711","permalink":"https://abbasacar.github.io/publication/waca-patent/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/waca-patent/","section":"publication","summary":"Systems and methods for continuous and transparent verification, authentication, and identification of individuals are provided.

With this, WACA continuously ensures that the current user is the user who logged in initially. We implemented the WACA framework and evaluated its performance on real devices with real users. The empirical evaluation of WACA reveals that WACA is feasible and its error rate is as low as 1% with 30 seconds of processing time and 2 - 3% for 20 seconds. The computational overhead is minimal.

Secure multiparty computation (SMC) is a viable panacea for this, allowing distributed parties to make computations while the parties learn nothing about their data, but the final result. Although SMC is instrumental in such distributed settings, it does not provide any guarantees not to leak any information about individuals to adversaries. Differential privacy (DP) can be utilized to address this; however, achieving SMC with DP is not a trivial task, either. In this paper, we propose a novel Secure Multiparty Distributed Differentially Private (SM-DDP) protocol to achieve secure and private computations in a multiparty environment. Specifically, with our protocol, we simultaneously achieve SMC and DP in distributed settings focusing on linear regression on horizontally distributed data. That is, parties do not see each others' data and further, can not infer information about individuals from the final constructed statistical model. Any statistical model function that allows independent calculation of local statistics can be computed through our protocol. The protocol implements homomorphic encryption for SMC and functional mechanism for DP to achieve the desired security and privacy guarantees. In this work, we first introduce the theoretical foundation for the SM-DDP protocol and then evaluate its efficacy and performance on two different datasets. Our results show that one can achieve individual-level privacy through the proposed protocol with distributed DP, which is independently applied by each party in a distributed fashion. Moreover, our results also show that the SM-DDP protocol incurs minimal computational overhead, is scalable, and provides security and privacy guarantees.","tags":null,"title":"Achieving Secure and Differentially Private Computations in Multiparty Settings","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
