I am a Ph.D. candidate at Florida International University, under the supervision of Professor [Selcuk Uluagac ](https://web.eng.fiu.edu/selcuk/)at the Cyber-Physical Systems Security Lab.  My research interest lies in the application of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to explore the security and privacy implications of emerging technologies and their associated threats. During my Ph.D., I collaborated with Google Research and published papers at prestigious conferences (e.g., USENIX 23', WWW 24'). 

My industry experience spans various roles where I've applied machine learning to address different types of real-world problems. Most recently, I worked at Keysight Technologies as a Machine Learning intern, where I was a part of their recommendation system team. Beyond my primary research, I am passionate about leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to tackle complex, real-world challenges across different domains.
