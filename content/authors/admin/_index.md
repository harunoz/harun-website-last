I am a Ph.D. candidate at Florida International University, where I work under the supervision of Professor [Selcuk Uluagac](https://web.eng.fiu.edu/selcuk/) in the Cyber-Physical Systems Security Lab. My research interest lies in the application of advanced machine learning techniques to explore the security and privacy implications of emerging technologies and their associated threats. During my Ph.D., I collaborated with Google Research and my works have been published in various conferences such as USENIX '23 and WWW '24.

My industry experience spans various roles where I've applied machine learning to address different types of real-world problems. Most recently, I worked at Keysight Technologies as a Machine Learning intern on their recommendation system team. Beyond my primary research, I am passionate about leveraging innovative machine learning techniques to tackle complex, real-world challenges across different domains.
