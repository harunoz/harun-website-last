I am a Ph.D. candidate at Florida International University, under the supervision of Professor [Selcuk Uluagac ](https://web.eng.fiu.edu/selcuk/)at the Cyber-Physical Systems Security Lab. In addition to that, I recently became an invited expert at the [Privacy Interest Group on W3C. ](https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/privacy/ipr/)\
\
My primary research interests revolve around system and web security, with a focus on the security and privacy of emerging web technologies and applications. I utilize data-centric methods to investigate online threats and develop tools to identify them in a scalable and dependable way.
