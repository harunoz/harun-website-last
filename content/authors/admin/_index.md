I am a Ph.D. candidate at Florida International University, under the supervision of Professor [Selcuk Uluagac ](https://web.eng.fiu.edu/selcuk/)at the Cyber-Physical Systems Security Lab. In addition to that, I recently became an invited expert at the [Privacy Interest Group on W3C. ](https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/privacy/ipr/)\
\
My research area involves using data analysis and machine learning techniques to analyze the security and privacy implications of emerging technologies, as well as their associated threats. In addition to my core research, I have industry experience as a software engineer, developing anomaly detection systems by leveraging various machine learning algorithms and data analytics techniques.
