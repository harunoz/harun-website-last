I am currently a Computer Engineering Ph.D. student at Florida International University, where I am a part of the [](https://seclab.illinois.edu/)[Cyber-Physical Systems Security Lab](https://csl.fiu.edu/) advised by [](https://cgunter.cs.illinois.edu/)Professor [Selcuk Uluagac](https://sites.google.com/fiu.edu/selcuk).

 I am primarily conducting research related to general systems and web security topics. As a Ph.D. student, I am always looking forward to embarking on new and challenging problems in the cybersecurity field.
